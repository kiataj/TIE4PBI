# TIE4PBI
This MATLAB script gives an estimation of the fringe visibility of the transport of intensity equaition (TIE) for X-ray propagation-based imaging (PBI). 
In this script takes into account imaging system point speard function. You need to provide detector and the source pont spread functions FWHM. 
This allows an estimation of optimal geometry prior to setting the PBI scan.
