# TIE4PBI
This MATLAB script provides an estimation of the fringe visibility of the Transport of Intensity Equation (TIE) for X-ray Propagation-Based Imaging (PBI).
This script takes into account the imaging system's point spread function. You need to provide the detector and the source point spread functions' FWHM.
This allows for an estimation of optimal geometry before setting the PBI scan.
